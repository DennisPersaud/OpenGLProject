# OpenGLProject
This is a program that uses C++ and OpenGL to generate a 3D wood textured three legged stool with a simulated camera.

## Reflection
I chose a three-legged stool because I felt it would be a challenging object to create but not too geometrically complicated to be outside of the project’s guidelines. I chose this object at random; I was thinking of something that would be not too hard but not too easy to make. I was able to program the functionality required.

The user can navigate my 3D object my moving the mouse. Moving the mouse up and down orbits the object vertically, while moving the mouse left and right orbits the object horizontally. I set up the camera using the glutPassiveMotionFunc so that the user does not need to press a button to orbit the object, they only have to move the mouse. I passed a function called UMouseMove with the “x” and “y” coordinates of the current window as its parameters to the glutPassiveMotionFunc. Within the UMouseMove function the coordinates are passed to the URenderGraphics function by replacing the camera forward vector with radians normalized as a unit vector, this is then passed to the lookAt function which transforms the mouse movement to orbital camera movement around the object. 

The custom functions that I used to make my code reusable are the UResizeWindow, URenderGraphics, UCreateShader, UCreateBuffers, UMouseMove, & UGenerateTexture functions. The UResizeWindow function resizes the window by passing a predefined width and height to the glViewport function which sets the viewport to the specified parameters. The URenderGraphics function is responsible for displaying the graphics on the screen, this is a void function that does not have a return value. In this function we set up our window by activating and deactivating individual aspects of the context window such as the z-depth, the memory buffer objects used for drawing the vertex array object on, the object and camera transforms for manipulating the camera and the object , the shader variables which define how the object is rendered within the 3D array. The UCreateShader function is another void function with no return value, this function creates our shader program. This function defines the variables for the vertex shader which renders the coordinates of each vertex on the 3D array, the fragment shader which defines how the pixels in between the vertices are colored, the lamp vertex shader & lamp fragment shaders provide similar functionality as the vertex shaders but they are responsible for how the lighting is rendered within the 3D array. The UCreateBuffers function is where we set the individual coordinates of each vertex position as well as their color on the buffer object stored in the allocated memory space. We use this function to generate the buffers for the object and the lighting and bind them together in respect to their position data. The UMouseMove function is responsible for how the coordinates of the mouse’s location within the context translates to how the camera navigates around the virtual object. This is done by passing the coordinates of the location of the mouse within the context to calculate how the camera is moved within the context. Finally, the UGenerateTexture generates the texture for the object from a user specified image and binds it to the object. These functions are reusable because they are individual functions that are responsible for single tasks making the program modular in design. Each function can be swapped or commented out easily making the program easier to read & debug while providing structure to the code itself.
